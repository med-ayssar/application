%Sehr geehrter Herr DI Dr. Pezi,\\[1em]
Dear \contact, \\[1em]

%As I am approaching the final phase of my master study, I was really concerned about the path that I want to take in my career. Being a software developer in a static filed without really feeling and touching my creation is kind of upsetting and made me look for another way to see the position of the software developer.

%Here comes the discovery of neuroscience, its strong relation to computer science and the great contribution that could make to the humankind. Demystifying the mechanics of the brain and unveiling its secret may lead us to understanding the source of the consciousness and perhaps taking a high-resolution snapshot of the neurons responsible for generating our thoughts, dreams and even controlling them.
As I am approaching the final phase of my master study, I had the thought of looking for a new student assistant job that would put me on the right path finding an interesting master thesis project.  In the last semester, I had a seminar about neuro-inspired computing lead by Prof. Dr. Abigail Morrison. There comes the discovery of neuroscience, its strong relation to computer science and the great contribution that one could make to the humankind. Demystifying the mechanics of the brain and unveiling its secrets may lead us to understanding the source of consciousness and perhaps taking a high-resolution snapshot of the neurons responsible for generating our thoughts, dreams and even controlling them.


%Solving challenges of today and of tomorrow requires a new sophisticated way to representing the problems from various angles and new intelligent algorithms that can \emph{think} and \emph{compute} faster. Such development requires a strong well-founded architecture that supports the work between hardware and software.

I have always been fascinated by the impact of math in our life and having obtained a good respectful background in both fields of math and computer science and having the strong motivation to be an active member in the science community, I find myself willing and able to contribute to both fields.

During my study at RWTH and my first experience in Fraunhofer IPT, I have managed to improve myself in both soft/hard-skills and I strongly believe that with a certain level of motivation, determination and experience in computer science and software development we can take the humanity to the next level. Therefore, I think as a master student in computer science at RWTH that \emph{ SimLab Neuroscience} would be the next interesting path in my academic and professional career.

I hope to be given the opportunity, as I am confident that I am capable of meeting and possibly even exceed your expectations.

Thank you for considering my application.
